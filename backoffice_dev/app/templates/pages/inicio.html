                      <p class="text-secondary"> Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
                        roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
                        McClinton, a Latin professor at Hampered-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more
                        obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the
                        word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
                        1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Minibus Bono rum et Malo rum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
                        written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
                        Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in
                        section 1.10.32 </p>

I hosted for a few years, enjoyed it, and am returning to it after  a work-related break. I love the opportunity it gives, as a host, to meet the widest range of people, with all sorts of interests and profiles. Madrid is a great place for a holiday - it can be as relaxed (all-day tapas, siestas) or as lively (bars & clubs everywhere, except for my street fortunately) and as cultural (I'm really close to the 4 major galleries) as you like. And for football aficionados,  well, it's obvious! I would be delighted to give as much or as little guidance as you want to have. Come & stay!",

         "It can be said without hesitation that this flat enjoys the best location on offer for a holiday in Madrid. Practically a stone's throw away from Madrid's 3 most important art galleries (Prado, Thyssen and Reina Sofia), it straddles the historic Barrio de las Letras and the Huertas Neighbourhoods with their cultural offer and bustling nightlife, while being a 5 minute walk away from Madrid’s famous Retiro Park and 10 minutes from walk from the Puerta del Sol. The street itself is beautiful, lined with bars, restaurants and taverns but the flat is very quiet at night. All of central Madrid (Sol, Gran Via, Lavapies, Plaza Mayor) is within walking distance from the flat..",
